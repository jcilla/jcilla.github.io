Dear internet,

Today I fucked up.

My friends at work play Hearthstone, and today Blizzard announced new formats for competitive play: Standard (only the last two years of cards) and Wild (anything goes). We were discussing the topic using the corporate chat client. For who knows what reason, Oliver was curious how many syllables the word "wild" has. He linked us to a site describing diphthongs, because "wild" apparently is one.

>Gabe C. 2:08 PM: what's a diphthong?

Naturally, I began typing "ur a dip thong". It was the obvious choice. In the meantime, Gabe tried to close an ad, but accidentally close out of the chat instead. He asked Oliver to add him back in.

I pressed enter. Then too many things happened too fast.

>2:08 PM Gabe C. has left the chat.

Oliver accidentally added the wrong Gabe back in. So today I called some random Qualcomm employee a dip thong. Imagine being that guy, coming back from a well-deserved coffee break, settling back down to continue picking apart that frustrating section of code, when all of a sudden some random fukboi tells you "ur a dip thong" out of nowhere. Ruined his day.

I'm expecting a call from HR soon...
